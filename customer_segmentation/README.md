# Customer Segmentation with RFM and K-means

We will use the Online retail dataset from UCI machine learning repository - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail.

It's already been pre-cleaned from the outliers and missing data and saved as OnlineCleaned.xlsx that is used here. The code for cleaning and data preparation can be found in my git repo - https://github.com/karolisurbonas/cleaning-online-retail-dataset
