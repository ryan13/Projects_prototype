    "Budgets for schools and school districts are huge, complex, and unwieldy. It's no easy task to digest where and how schools are using their resources [source](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/46/box-plots-for-education-reboot/). Education Resource Strategies is a non-profit that tackles just this task with the goal of letting districts be smarter, more strategic, and more effective in their spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare budget or expenditure data across districts, ERS assigns every line item to certain categories in a comprehensive financial spending framework. For instance, Object_Type describes what the spending \"is\"—Base Salary/Compensation, Benefits, Stipends & Other Compensation, Equipment & Equipment Lease, Property Rental, and so on. Other categories describe what the spending \"does,\" which groups of students benefit, and where the funds come from.   \n",

    "\n",
    "The task is a **multi-class-multi-label classification problem** with the goal of attaching canonical labels to the freeform text in budget line items. These labels let ERS understand how schools are spending money and tailor their strategy recommendations to improve outcomes for students, teachers, and administrators.\n",
