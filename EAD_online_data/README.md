# Cleaning Online Retail dataset 

Will clean this dataset
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail

This repository will outline rules for cleaning the Online Retail dataset, and publish two datasets:
- `OnlineClean.xlsx` - original data set cleaned from negative and null values. **Purpose** - do it once so other repositories can use it without the need to add same lines of code to clean it.
- `OnlineSampled.xlsx` - 20% randomly sampled values from the clean dataset with only UK transactions filtered out. **Purpose** - for my *Customer Segmentation in Python* course with Datacamp, they have file size restrictions. 

The data will be used in:
- My other repositories on cohort analysis, association rules mining, and customer segmentation
- Datacamp course on Customer Segmentation in Python
- Other use cases, not yet defined here.
